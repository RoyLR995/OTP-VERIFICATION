# OTP-VERIFICATION
This is a mini project which helps in verifying the OTP.

I used tkinter and twilio modules to develop OTP Verification GUI using Python.

program1.py will open a tkinter window which will direct to program2.py (tkinter window) as clicked on the Generate OTP button.

OTP Verification sends a special OTP verification code on registration and login to validate users' email addresses and mobile numbers.

It eliminates the chance that a person will register using a fictitious email address or mobile number.

OTP Verification verifies the Email Address/Mobile Number of users by sending a unique OTP verification code during registration and login.

This is a tkinter GUI application in Python for OTP (One-time Password) verification.

It creates a window with a visually appealing design and
includes the components like labels, generating buttons
etc.

Uses tools like python, Tkinter library, Subprocess module, PhotoImage class and few other.
